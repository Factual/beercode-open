# Beercode: Code Guaranteed by Beer
Factual has an internal repository called "beercode," in which every author
guarantees their code's correctness by buying a beer for the first Factualite
to discover a logic error or significant performance improvement. This
repository is a subset of beercode released as open-source software -- and of
course the original beer guarantee still applies. Cheers!
